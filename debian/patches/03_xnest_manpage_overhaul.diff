 .SH NAME
 Xnest \- a nested X server
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 .B Xnest
-[-options]
+[
+.I options
+]
 .SH DESCRIPTION
-\fIXnest\fP is a client and a server.  \fIXnest\fP is a client of the
-real server which manages windows and graphics requests on its behalf.
-\fIXnest\fP is a server to its own clients.  \fIXnest\fP manages
-windows and graphics requests on their behalf.  To these clients
-\fIXnest\fP appears to be a conventional server.
+.B Xnest
+is both an X client and an X server.
+.B Xnest
+is a client of the real server which manages windows and graphics requests on
+its behalf.
+.B Xnest
+is a server to its own clients.
+.B Xnest
+manages windows and graphics requests on their behalf.
+To these clients,
+.B Xnest
+appears to be a conventional server.
 .SH OPTIONS
-\fIXnest\fP supports all standard options of the sample server
-implementation.  For more details, please see the manual page on your
-system for \fIXserver\fP.  The following additional arguments are
-supported as well.
-.TP 4
-.B \-display \fIstring\fP
+.B Xnest
+supports all standard options of the sample server implementation.
+For more details, please see
+.BR Xserver (__appmansuffix__).
+The following additional arguments are supported as well.
+.TP
+.BI "\-display " string
 This option specifies the display name of the real server that
-\fIXnest\fP should try to connect with.  If it is not provided on the
-command line \fIXnest\fP will read the \fIDISPLAY\fP environment
-variable in order to find out the same information.
-.TP 4
+.B Xnest
+should try to connect to.
+If it is not provided on the command line,
+.B Xnest
+will read the
+.I DISPLAY
+environment variable in order to find out this information.
+.TP
 .B \-sync
-This option tells \fIXnest\fP to synchronize its window and graphics
-operations with the real server.  This is a useful option for
-debugging, but it will slow down the performance considerably.  It
-should not be used unless absolutely necessary.
-.TP 4
+This option tells
+.B Xnest

+This is a useful option for debugging, but it will slow down
+.BR Xnest 's
+performance considerably.
+It should not be used unless absolutely necessary.
+.TP
 .B \-full
-This option tells \fIXnest\fP to utilize full regeneration of real
-server objects and reopen a new connection to the real server each
-time the nested server regenerates.  The sample server implementation
-regenerates all objects in the server when the last client of this
-server terminates.  When this happens, \fIXnest\fP by default
-maintains the same top level window and the same real server
-connection in each new generation.  If the user selects full
-regeneration, even the top level window and the connection to the real
-server will be regenerated for each server generation.
-.TP 4
-.B \-class \fIstring\fP
+This option tells
+.B Xnest
+to utilize full regeneration of real server objects and reopen a new connection
+to the real server each time the nested server regenerates.
+The sample server implementation regenerates all objects in the server when the
+last client of this server terminates.
+When this happens,
+.B Xnest
+by default maintains the same top-level window and the same real server
+connection in each new generation.
+If the user selects full regeneration, even the top-level window and the
+connection to the real server will be regenerated for each server generation.
+.TP
+.BI "\-class " string
 This option specifies the default visual class of the nested server.
-It is similar to the \fI-cc\fP option from the set of standard options
-except that it will accept a string rather than a number for the
-visual class specification.  The string must be one of the following
-six values: \fIStaticGray\fP, \fIGrayScale\fP, \fIStaticColor\fP,
-\fIPseudoColor\fP, \fITrueColor\fP, or \fIDirectColor\fP.  If both,
-\fI-class\fP and \fI-cc\fP options are specified, the last instance of
-either option assumes precedence.  The class of the default visual of
-the nested server need not be the same as the class of the default
-visual of the real server; although, it has to be supported by the
-real server.  See \fIxdpyinfo\fP for a list of supported visual
-classes on the real server before starting \fIXnest\fP.  If the user
-chooses a static class, all the colors in the default colormap will be
-preallocated.  If the user chooses a dynamic class, colors in the
-default colormap will be available to individual clients for
-allocation.
-.TP 4
-.B \-depth \fIint\fP
+It is similar to the
+.B \-cc
+option from the set of standard options except that it will accept a string
+rather than a number for the visual class specification.
+The
+.I string
+must be one of the following six values:
+.BR StaticGray ,
+.BR GrayScale ,
+.BR StaticColor ,
+.BR PseudoColor ,
+.BR TrueColor ,
+or
+.BR DirectColor .
+If both the
+.B \-class
+and
+.B \-cc
+options are specified, the last instance of either option takes precedence.
+The class of the default visual of the nested server need not be the same as the
+class of the default visual of the real server, but it must be supported by the
+real server.
+Use
+.BR xdpyinfo (__appmansuffix__)
+to obtain a list of supported visual classes on the real server before starting
+.BR Xnest .
+If the user chooses a static class, all the colors in the default color map will
+be preallocated.
+If the user chooses a dynamic class, colors in the default color map will be
+available to individual clients for allocation.
+.TP
+.BI "\-depth " int
 This option specifies the default visual depth of the nested server.
-The depth of the default visual of the nested server need not be the
-same as the depth of the default visual of the real server; although,
-it has to be supported by the real server.  See \fIxdpyinfo\fP for a
-list of supported visual depths on the real server before starting
-\fIXnest\fP.
-.TP 4
+The depth of the default visual of the nested server need not be the same as the
+depth of the default visual of the real server, but it must be supported by the
+real server.
+Use
+.BR xdpyinfo (__appmansuffix__)
+to obtain a list of supported visual depths on the real server before starting
+.BR Xnest .
+.TP
 .B \-sss
-This option tells \fIXnest\fP to use the software screen saver.  By
-default \fIXnest\fP will use the screen saver that corresponds to the
-hardware screen saver in the real server.  Of course, even this screen
-saver is software generated since \fIXnest\fP does not control any
-actual hardware.  However, it is treated as a hardware screen saver
-within the sample server code.
-.TP 4
-.B \-geometry \fIWxH+X+Y\fP
-This option specifies geometry parameters for the top level
-\fIXnest\fP windows.  These windows corresponds to the root windows of
-the nested server.  The width and height specified with this option
-will be the maximum width and height of each top level \fIXnest\fP
-window.  \fIXnest\fP will allow the user to make any top level window
-smaller, but it will not actually change the size of the nested server
-root window.  As of yet, there is no mechanism within the sample
-server implementation to change the size of the root window after
-screen initialization.  In order to do so, one would probably need to
-extend the X protocol.  Therefore, it is not likely that this will be
-available any time soon.  If this option is not specified \fIXnest\fP
-will choose width and height to be 3/4 of the dimensions of the root
-window of the real server.
-.TP 4
-.B \-bw \fIint\fP
-This option specifies the border width of the top level \fIXnest\fP
-window.  The integer parameter must be a positive number.  The default
-border width is 1.
-.TP 4
-.B \-name \fIstring\fP
-This option specifies the name of the top level \fIXnest\fP window.
+This option tells
+.B Xnest
+to use the software screen saver.
+By default,
+.B Xnest
+will use the screen saver that corresponds to the hardware screen saver in the
+real server.
+Of course, even this screen saver is software-generated since
+.B Xnest
+does not control any actual hardware.
+However, it is treated as a hardware screen saver within the sample server code.
+.TP
+.B \-geometry \fIW\fBx\fIH\fB+\fIX\fB+\fIY\fP
+This option specifies the geometry parameters for the top-level
+.B Xnest
+window.
+See \(lqGEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS\(rq in
+.BR X (__miscmansuffix__)
+for a discusson of this option's syntax.
+This window corresponds to the root window of the nested server.
+The width
+.I W
+and height
+.I H
+specified with this option will be the maximum width and height of each
+top-level
+.B Xnest
+window.
+.B Xnest
+will allow the user to make any top-level window smaller, but it will not
+actually change the size of the nested server root window.
+.B Xnest
+does not yet support the RANDR extension for resizing, rotation, and reflection
+of the root window.
+If this option is not specified,
+.B Xnest
+will choose
+.I W
+and
+.I H
+to be 3/4ths the dimensions of the root window of the real server.
+.TP
+.BI "\-bw " int
+This option specifies the border width of the top-level
+.B Xnest
+window.
+The integer parameter
+.I int
+must be positive.
+The default border width is 1.
+.TP
+.BI "\-name " string
+This option specifies the name of the top-level
+.B Xnest
+window as
+.IR string .
 The default value is the program name.
-.TP 4
-.B \-scrns \fIint\fP
-This option specifies the number of screens to create in the nested
-server.  For each screen, \fIXnest\fP will create a separate top level
-window.  Each screen is referenced by the number after the dot in the
-client display name specification.  For example, \fIxterm -display
-:1.1\fP will open an \fIxterm\fP client in the nested server with the
-display number \fI:1\fP on the second screen.  The number of screens
-is limited by the hard coded constant in the server sample code which
-is usually 3.

+.B :1
+on the second screen.
+The number of screens is limited by the hard-coded constant in the server sample
+code, which is usually 3.
+.TP
 .B \-install
-This option tells \fIXnest\fP to do its own colormap installation by
-bypassing the real window manager.  For it to work properly the user
-will probably have to temporarily quit the real window manager.  By
-default \fIXnest\fP will keep the nested client window whose colormap
-should be installed in the real server in the
-\fIWM\_COLORMAP\_WINDOWS\fP property of the top level \fIXnest\fP
-window.  If this colormap is of the same visual type as the root
-window of the nested server, \fIXnest\fP will associate this colormap
-with the top level \fIXnest\fP window as well.  Since this does not
-have to be the case, window managers should look primarily at the
-\fIWM\_COLORMAP\_WINDOWS\fP property rather than the colormap
-associated with the top level \fIXnest\fP window.  Unfortunately,
-window managers are not very good at doing that yet so this option
-might come in handy.
-.TP 4
-.B \-parent \fIwindow_id\fP
-This option tells \fIXnest\fP to use the \fIwindow_id\fP as the
-root window instead of creating a window. This option is used
-by the xrx xnestplugin.
-.SH USAGE 
-Starting up \fIXnest\fP is as simple as starting up \fIxclock\fP from
-a terminal emulator.  If a user wishes to run \fIXnest\fP on the same
-workstation as the real server, it is important that the nested server
-is given its own listening socket address.  Therefore, if there is a
-server already running on the user's workstation, \fIXnest\fP will
-have to be started up with a new display number.  Since there is
-usually no more than one server running on a workstation, specifying
-\fIXnest :1\fP on the command line will be sufficient for most users.
-For each server running on the workstation the display number needs to
-be incremented by one.  Thus, if you wish to start another
-\fIXnest\fP, you will need to type \fIXnest :2\fP on the command line.
-.PP
-To run clients in the nested server each client needs to be given the
-same display number as the nested server.  For example, \fIxterm
--display :1\fP will start up an \fIxterm\fP in the first nested server
-and \fIxterm -display :2\fP will start an \fIxterm\fP in the second
-nested server from the example above.  Additional clients can be
-started from these \fIxterm\fPs in each nested server.
-.SH XNEST AS A CLIENT
-\fIXnest\fP behaves and looks to the real server and other real
-clients as another real client.  It is a rather demanding client,
-however, since almost any window or graphics request from a nested
-client will result in a window or graphics request from \fIXnest\fP to
-the real server.  Therefore, it is desirable that \fIXnest\fP and the
-real server are on a local network, or even better, on the same
-machine.  As of now, \fIXnest\fP assumes that the real server supports
-the shape extension.  There is no way to turn off this assumption
-dynamically.  \fIXnest\fP can be compiled without the shape extension
-built in, and in that case the real server need not support it.  The
-dynamic shape extension selection support should be considered in
-further development of \fIXnest\fP.
-.PP
-Since \fIXnest\fP need not use the same default visual as the the real
-server, the top level window of the \fIXnest\fP client always has its
-own colormap.  This implies that other windows' colors will not be
-displayed properly while the keyboard or pointer focus is in the
-\fIXnest\fP window, unless the real server has support for more than
-one installed colormap at any time.  The colormap associated with the
-top window of the \fIXnest\fP client need not be the appropriate
-colormap that the nested server wants installed in the real server.
-In the case that a nested client attempts to install a colormap of a
-different visual from the default visual of the nested server,
-\fIXnest\fP will put the top window of this nested client and all
-other top windows of the nested clients that use the same colormap
-into the \fIWM\_COLORMAP\_WINDOWS\fP property of the top level
-\fIXnest\fP window on the real server.  Thus, it is important that the
-real window manager that manages the \fIXnest\fP top level window
-looks at the \fIWM\_COLORMAP\_WINDOWS\fP property rather than the
-colormap associated with the top level \fIXnest\fP window.  Since most
-window managers appear to not implement this convention properly as of
-yet, \fIXnest\fP can optionally do direct installation of colormaps
-into the real server bypassing the real window manager.  If the user
-chooses this option, it is usually necessary to temporarily disable
-the real window manager since it will interfere with the \fIXnest\fP
-scheme of colormap installation.
-.PP
-Keyboard and pointer control procedures of the nested server change
-the keyboard and pointer control parameters of the real server.
-Therefore, after \fIXnest\fP is started up, it will change the
-keyboard and pointer controls of the real server to its own internal
-defaults.  Perhaps there should be a command line option to tell
-\fIXnest\fP to inherit the keyboard and pointer control parameters
-from the real server rather than imposing its own.  This is a future
-consideration.
-.SH XNEST AS A SERVER
-\fIXnest\fP as a server looks exactly like a real server to its own
-clients.  For the clients there is no way of telling if they are
-running on a real or a nested server.
-.PP
-As already mentioned, \fIXnest\fP is a very user friendly server when
-it comes to customization.  \fIXnest\fP will pick up a number of
-command line arguments that can configure its default visual class and
-depth, number of screens, etc.  In the future, \fIXnest\fP should read
-a customization input file to provide even greater freedom and
-simplicity in selecting the desired layout.  Unfortunately, there is
-no support for backing store and save under as of yet, but this should
-also be considered in the future development of \fIXnest\fP.
+This option tells
+.B Xnest
+to do its own color map installation by bypassing the real window manager.
+For it to work properly, the user will probably have to temporarily quit the
+real window manager.
+By default,
+.B Xnest
+will keep the nested client window whose color map should be installed in the

+Since this does not have to be the case, window managers should look primarily
+at the

+property rather than the color map associated with the top-level
+.B Xnest
+window.
+.\" Is the following still true?  This sentence is several years old.
+Unfortunately, window managers are not very good at doing that yet so this
+option might come in handy.
+.TP
+.BI "\-parent " window_id
+This option tells
+.B Xnest
+to use
+.I window_id
+as the root window instead of creating a window.
+.\" XRX is dead, dead, dead.
+.\" This option is used by the xrx xnestplugin.

 .PP
 The only apparent intricacy from the users' perspective about using
-\fIXnest\fP as a server is the selection of fonts.  \fIXnest\fP
-manages fonts by loading them locally and then passing the font name
-to the real server and asking it to load that font remotely.  This
-approach avoids the overload of sending the glyph bits across the
-network for every text operation, although it is really a bug.  The
-proper implementation of fonts should be moved into the \fIos\fP
-layer. The consequence of this approach is that the user will have to
-worry about two different font paths - a local one for the nested
-server and a remote one for the real server - since \fIXnest\fP does
-not propagate its font path to the real server.  The reason for this
-is because real and nested servers need not run on the same file
-system which makes the two font paths mutually incompatible.  Thus, if
-there is a font in the local font path of the nested server, there is
-no guarantee that this font exists in the remote font path of the real
-server.  \fIXlsfonts\fP client, if run on the nested server will list
-fonts in the local font path and if run on the real server will list
-fonts in the remote font path.  Before a font can be successfully
-opened by the nested server it has to exist in local and remote font
-paths.  It is the users' responsibility to make sure that this is the
-case.
