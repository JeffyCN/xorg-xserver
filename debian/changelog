xorg-server (1:1.0.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Add versioned dependency on x11-common
  * Remove old cruft in our patches directory
  * Port patches from trunk
    + 030_libvgahw_gcc4_volatile_fix.diff
    + general/026_xc_programs_manpage_overhaul.diff
    + arm/303_arm_cache_flush.diff

    + s390/500_s390_support.diff
    + debian/910_debian_Xserver_RTFF.diff
  * add 04_read_rom_in_chunks.diff. This reads PCI ROM in large chunks rather
    than one byte at a time. This patch by Alex Williamson and forwarded to us
    by Dann Frazier. Thanks to both of them. (closes: #353168)
  * Don't build xserver-xorg-core on s390. This means putting all the other
    arches as being explicitly listed. Damn !s390.
  * Version the conflict with xserver-xfree86 to allow for the transition
    package to be installed
  * Remove README.DRI, as it is non-free. Add it to prune list.
  * Add 10_dont_look_in_home_for_config.diff to prevent looking in a user's
    home directory for xorg.conf. Thanks Daniel Stone for the patch.

xorg-server (1:1.0.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian
  * Add bison and flex to the build-depends
  * Define INSTALL in debian/rules
  * Add xserver-xorg-core dependency xserver-xorg-video-all |
    xserver-xorg-video. The former is a metapackage that depends on all the
    video drivers we ship and the latter is a virtual package that each video
    driver provides. This scheme will install the metapackage by default but
    will permit any single video driver to satsify the dependency. Do the same
    thing for the input drivers.
  * switch dpatch build-dependency to quilt
  * Deal with mesa packaging rename: build-dep on mesa-swrast-source ->
    mesa-swx11-source
  * Change xserver-core depends to be on x11-common rather than xorg-common
  * Have xserver-xorg-dev install the files in /usr/share/aclocal so we get
    xorg-server.m4
  * Manually set permissions on serverabiver installation
  * Set the default font path to /usr/share/fonts/X11 instead of 
    /usr/share/X11/fonts. Thanks Eugene Konev.

xorg-server (1:0.99.2+cvs.20051025-3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Version mesa-swrast-source Build-Dep to 6.4.0 or higher, so GLcore is a
    little less crash-happy (e.g. when moving your glxgears window).
  * Export /usr/share/xserver-xorg/serverabiver to xserver-xorg-dev, which
    describes the relationship needed from a driver on xserver-xorg-core.
