  * Bring xprint back into the xorg fold.
    - include existing patches:
      - 91_ttf2pt1 allows Xprint to use ttf2pt1 for Type1 font handling
      	(but extract and apply manually the patch to
       	hw/xprint/ps/Makefile.am so it may be applied by autoconf)
      - 91_ttf2pt1_updates brings ttf2pt1 into the modern X11R7.1 world
      - 92_xprint-security-holes-fix.patch places PS/PDF file output
      	into the user's home directory (~/Xprintjobs), more secure than
      	a shared /tmp/Xprintjobs
      - 93_spooltodir_check_file_exists ensures output filenames are
      	less than 256 characters in length
      - 93_xprint_fonts_fix released references to font names after use.
     - enable freetype support for Xprint.
     - add descriptions to debian/control and Build-Dependency on
       x11proto-print-dev
  * Run autoreconf to update changes to hw/xprint/ps/Makefile.am.

  * Move serverabiver file to serverminver. Use serverabiver to store the
    actual video ABI version number (1.1 right now). This will allow drivers
    to automatically generate their Provides: xserver-xorg-video-* line when
    built against a particular server version. The rename of the files
    is to better denote what they actually are.

xorg-server (1:1.0.2-9) UNRELEASED; urgency=high

  [ Denis Barbier ]
  * Fix 13_debian_add_xkbpath_env_variable.diff, XKBPATH environment
    variable was not always taken into account.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Remove two Ubuntu packaging holdovers. Have xvfb recommend xbase-clients
    rather than xauth, and have xserver-xorg-core recommend xkb-data rather
    than xkeyboard-config. Thanks Sterling MacNay.
  * Security update. Fix for setuid privledge escalation vulernabilities.
    See http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2006-June/016146.html for
    the full advisory.

  [ Jurij Smakov ]
  * Stop including the non-existent asm/kbio.h header file in
    hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/lnx_{io,kbd}.c to avoid the build failure
    on sparc.

xorg-server (1:1.0.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move xserverrc back to xbase-clients. Thanks Benjamin Mesing.
  * Add 15_security_allocate_local.diff. This fixes Bug fd.o bug #6642.
    Fix buffer overflow in Render.  (CVE 2006-1526). Patch by Eric Anholt.

xorg-server (1:1.0.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Use -DNO_INLINE on s390. Thanks Bastian Blank and Julien Cristau.
    (closes: #362641)
  * Re-add xvfb-run and manpage to xvfb package. Thanks Josselin Mouette and
    Jamie Wilkinson. (closes: #363494)
  * Add 014_debian_always_look_in_our_module_path.diff. This will cause the
    server to always look in the default module path even if they've specified
    an alternate path in their xorg.conf file via the ModulePath option. A
    note to users: you should remove this part of your xorg.conf unless you
    need it, as the server will look in the right place for modules if you
    don't specify a location.
  * Run dh_install with --list-missing
  * Add missing manpages all around. Thanks Roland Mas and Jan Hudec.
    (closes: #362489, #364199)
  * Actually install apps to xdmx-tools. Thanks Xavier Bestel.
    (closes: #356813)

  [ Denis Barbier ]
  * Add 13_debian_add_xkbpath_env_variable.diff so that the server takes
    the XKBPATH environment variable into account. (closes: #363229)

xorg-server (1:1.0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 11_debian_always_use_default_font_path.diff from Eugene Konev. This
    patch causes the server to add the default font path to whatever the user
    has specified. Right now, that's /usr/share/fonts/X11, as defined on
    configure in debian/rules. Thanks Eugene, this will definitely go a long
    way.
  * Document how to get rid of error loading glcore (and other modules) in
    NEWS.Debian. Thanks Matej Vela and others.
  * Provide the virtual 'xserver' package. Thanks Steve Langasek and Daniel
    Stone. (closes: #362750)
  * Add 12_security_policy_in_etc.diff from Eugene Konev. This will allow us
    to tell the server on configure to look in /etc/X11/xserver for the
    SecurityPolicy file. Thanks Joey Hess and Eugene. (closes: #362246)

  * Make xserver-xorg-core Architecture: any. (closes: #362150)
  * Build with --with-fontdir=/usr/share/fonts/X11. Remove
    --with-default-font-path option to make this work. Thanks Eugene Konev.

    + debian/910_debian_Xserver_RTFF.diff
  * add 04_read_rom_in_chunks.diff. This reads PCI ROM in large chunks rather
    than one byte at a time. This patch by Alex Williamson and forwarded to us
    by Dann Frazier. Thanks to both of them. (closes: #353168)
  * Don't build xserver-xorg-core on s390. This means putting all the other
    arches as being explicitly listed. Damn !s390.
  * Version the conflict with xserver-xfree86 to allow for the transition
    package to be installed
  * Remove README.DRI, as it is non-free. Add it to prune list.
  * Add 10_dont_look_in_home_for_config.diff to prevent looking in a user's
    home directory for xorg.conf. Thanks Daniel Stone for the patch.

xorg-server (1:1.0.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian
  * Add bison and flex to the build-depends
  * Define INSTALL in debian/rules
  * Add xserver-xorg-core dependency xserver-xorg-video-all |
    xserver-xorg-video. The former is a metapackage that depends on all the
    video drivers we ship and the latter is a virtual package that each video
    driver provides. This scheme will install the metapackage by default but
    will permit any single video driver to satsify the dependency. Do the same
    thing for the input drivers.
  * switch dpatch build-dependency to quilt
  * Deal with mesa packaging rename: build-dep on mesa-swrast-source ->
    mesa-swx11-source
  * Change xserver-core depends to be on x11-common rather than xorg-common
  * Have xserver-xorg-dev install the files in /usr/share/aclocal so we get
    xorg-server.m4
  * Manually set permissions on serverabiver installation
  * Set the default font path to /usr/share/fonts/X11 instead of
    /usr/share/X11/fonts. Thanks Eugene Konev.

xorg-server (1:0.99.2+cvs.20051025-3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Version mesa-swrast-source Build-Dep to 6.4.0 or higher, so GLcore is a
    little less crash-happy (e.g. when moving your glxgears window).
  * Export /usr/share/xserver-xorg/serverabiver to xserver-xorg-dev, which
    describes the relationship needed from a driver on xserver-xorg-core.
